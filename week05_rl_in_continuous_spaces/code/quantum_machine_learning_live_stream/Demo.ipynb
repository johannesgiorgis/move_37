    "- The term 'Interference' refers to the electrons - which behave as waves inside a quantum waves - interference patterns which give rise to the quantum effects. \n",
    "- The reason that quantum effects such as electron waves are supported in such a structure - allowing it to behave as a qubit - is due to the properties of the material from which it is made. \n",
    "- The large loop in the diagram is made from a metal called niobium (in contrast to conventional transistors which are mostly made from silicon). \n",

    "- In fact, the QPU is architected more like a biological brain than the common 'Von Neumann' architecture of a conventional silicon processor. \n",

    "- To perform a computation with many  qubits, they must all be sustained in interdependent superpositions of states \n",
    "- This is called “quantum-coherent” state, in which the qubits are said to be entangled.\n",
    "- That way, a tweak to one qubit may influence all the others. \n",
    "- This means that somehow computational operations on qubits count for more than they do for classical bits. \n",
    "- The computational resources increase in simple proportion to the number of bits for a classical device, but adding an extra qubit potentially doubles the resources of a quantum computer. \n",
    "- This is why the difference between a 5-qubit and a 50-qubit machine is so significant.\n",

    "\n",
    "- To carry out a quantum computation, you need to keep all your qubits coherent. This is hard.\n",
    "- Interactions of a system of quantum-coherent entities with their surrounding environment create channels through which the coherence rapidly “leaks out” in a process called decoherence. \n",
    "- Researchers seeking to build quantum computers must stave off decoherence, which they can currently do only for a fraction of a second. T\n",
    "- That challenge gets ever greater as the number of qubits, and hence the potential to interact with the environment,  increases. \n",
    "- This is largely why, even though quantum computing was first proposed by Richard Feynman in 1982 and the theory was worked out in the early 1990s, it has taken until now to make devices that can actually perform a meaningful computation.\n",
    "- Most of the time, the process of engineering quantum waves to do a calculation, and protecting them from outside interference long enough for that calculation to finish, is just more hassle than it's worth. \n",
    "- You get a little bit of a speed-up, maybe, but not enough to justify the extra overhead needed for quantum computing-- you're better off just running a fast classical algorithm on a top-of-the-line classical computer.\n",
