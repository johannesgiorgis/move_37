    "Robotics is a vast field of study, encompassing theories across multiple scientific disciplines. In this video, we'll program a robotic arm in a simulated environment to pick up an object. Along the way, we'll learn about both forward and inverse kinematics. We'll optimize our arms trajectory using calculus and observe how its angles change over time, measuring them with trigonometry. We'll code this in Python, this is an example of machine learning applied to robotic manipulation. Enjoy! \n",

    "\n",
    "Learn one of the most advanced reinforcement learning algorithms to emerge in 2018, which has advanced the field of robotics by leaps and bounds, Augmented Random Search. Follow along with the coding tutorial and teach your own robot how to walk in less than an hour!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "**Augmented Random Search**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Shallow learning algorithm\n",
    "- Random noise\n",
    "- Genetic evolution\n",
    "- Cutting edge performance on locomotion tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "**How it works (simplified)**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Add random noise($\\delta$) to the weights ($\\theta$)\n",
    "2. Run a test\n",
    "3. If the reward improves, keep the new weights\n",
    "4. Otherwise discard\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of gradient descent, we use a much simpler algorithm called the Method of Finite Differences to calculate updates to our weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Method of Finite Differences**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Generate random noise ($\\delta$) of the same shape as the weights ($\\theta$)\n",
    "2. Clone two versions of our current weights\n",
    "3. Add the noise to $\\theta{[+]}$, subtract from $\\theta{[-]}$\n",
    "4. Test out both versions one episode each, collect $r[+]$, $r[-]$\n",
    "5. Update the weights with: $ \\theta\\ += \\alpha\\ (\\ r[+] - r[-]\\ ) * \\delta $\n",
    "6. Test and repeat for maximum performance\n",
    "\n",
    "This algorithm works best if all inputs are squeezed between 0 and 1. This is called normalizing. We do this with a standard normalization algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "**Normalize the Inputs**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Normalized = (Inputs - Observation_mean)/ Observation_sigma\n",
    "- To track the mean, we keep a running average:\n",
    "    - mean = last_mean + (observation - last_mean) / num_observations\n",
    "\n",
    "**Training Loop**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Generate num_deltas deltas and evaluate positive and negative\n",
    "2. Run num_deltas episodes with positive and negative variations\n",
    "3. Collect rollouts as $(r[+], r[-], \\delta)$ tuples\n",
    "4. Calculate the standard deviation of all rewards (sigma_rewards)\n",
    "5. Sort the rollouts by maximum reward and select the best num_best_deltas rollouts\n",
    "6. $ step = sum(\\ (\\ r[+] - r[-]\\ )\\ * \\delta\\ ) $ for each best rollout\n",
    "7. theta += learning_rate / (num_best_deltas * sigma_rewards) * step\n",
    "8. Evaluate: play an episode with the new weights to measure improvement\n",
    "9. Continue until the desired performance is reached\n",

    "- Box2d (```pip install box2d```)\n",
    "- PyBullet environments (```pip install pybullet```) [optional]\n",

    "**Things to Try**:\n",
    "\n",

    "- Play around with the hyper-parameters\n",
    "- Try other environments (PyBullet Half Cheetah, Lunar Lander Continuous)\n",

    "- One way to make this faster is to employ multi-processing to utilize more than one CPU core to run several episodes in parallel\n",
