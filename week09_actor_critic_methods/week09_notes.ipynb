    "Drones are being used in real world applications around the world! They can help detect anomalies in crop yields, provide companies with physical assets a real-time continuous data stream, and help secure locations by giving teams an aerial view. We'll learn how a dron can learn to navigate a novel, complex environment using an advanced reinforcement learning technique called Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients. Its a mixture of policy gradients and actor critic, I'll go through the dependencies before explaining the real algorithm. Enjoy! \n",

    "\n",
    "**Basics:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Alternates between taking an actino and criticising the policy\n",
    "- **Actor**: decides the policy (which action to take) based on direct rewards\n",
    "- **Critic**: tells us how good our policy is relative to the environment state value estimates\n",
    "- Works with continuous action spaces\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Relation to to other methods:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Estimates both policy and value function (combines plicy and value based methods)\n",
    "- While policy gradients require waiting till theend of an episode, actor-critic updates at each step, greatly improving efficiency [source](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/an-intro-to-advantage-actor-critic-methods-lets-play-sonic-the-hedgehog-86d6240171d)\n",
    "- Gradient version of Policy Iteration [source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Ke-d1Itk3k)\n",

    "**Main Actor-Critic Methods:**\n",

    "- **A2C, Advantage Actor-Critic** uses the equation $A(S, A) = Q(S, A) - V(S)$ to get the advantage (extra reward) of an action over the estimated value of a state.
